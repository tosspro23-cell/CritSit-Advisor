# CritSit Advisor

**AI-powered decision support for high-impact customer escalations**  

---

## Problem
During critical customer escalations (CritSit), managers face:
- Information overload from Dynamics, Teams, and email.
- Fragmented ownership and unclear responsibilities.
- Delays in mitigation due to blockers and resource gaps.

---

## Solution
**CritSit Advisor** is an AI-powered assistant that:
- Consumes **case summaries** (Dynamics) and **chat snapshots** (Teams).
- Applies a structured **six-module framework**:
  1. Team Responsibility Clarification  
  2. Mitigation Priority Recommendation  
  3. Communication Draft Generation  
  4. Misunderstanding Resolution  
  5. Monitoring & Documentation Guidance  
  6. Strategy & Follow-up Planning
- Provides managers with **actionable insights** and clear decision paths.

---

## MVP (Hackathon Scope)
- Manual copy-paste of **case summaries** + **chat snapshots** as inputs.  
- Advisor generates structured recommendations and communication drafts.  
- Goal: validate **speed**, **accuracy**, and **transparency** improvements.

---

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Manual input testing.  
- **Phase 2:** Automated integration with Teams Copilot summaries.  
- **Phase 3:** Direct Dynamics API integration.  
- **Phase 4:** Expand to global CE&S adoption.

---

## How It Works
1. Copy Dynamics Case Summary + Teams Snapshot.  
2. Paste into CritSit Advisor input.  
3. Select output module (e.g., Mitigation Priority, Communication Draft).  
4. Receive structured guidance & suggested communication.
